# Welcome to React for Beginners 👶🏻

## Getting Started

**You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the application

The app will be live in https://loclahost:3000
